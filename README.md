## Description (100-word minimum)
> When people begin to collect more than a few houseplants, it can be hard to remember when they should be watered, especially if the plants are of different species. If every plant is watered at the same time one plant could receive too much water and another not enough. Our web app will help busy people keep all their plants alive and thriving by sending regular reminders on the most optimal days for each specific plant to be watered.
Once a user logs on, they will be able to view their current list of plants, add or delete plants, and customize their plant profile by assigning custom names and uploading pictures of their plants. In addition to sending reminders, the app will have a calendar showing the monthly watering schedule for all the userâ€™s plants.
